# Ansible Integration

## Objective
Integrate Ansible functionality into Eagle Terminal for automated network configuration and management.

## Implementation Details

1. Create `utils/ansible/ansible_manager.py`:
   - Implement Ansible playbook execution
   - Add inventory management
   - Implement role and module management

2. Update `ui/main_window/main_window.py`:
   - Add an Ansible management tab or dialog
   - Implement UI for managing and executing Ansible playbooks

3. Create `ui/dialogs/ansible_dialog.py`:
   - Implement a dialog for configuring Ansible settings and running playbooks

4. Update `Functions/ssh_manager.py`:
   - Add methods to execute Ansible tasks on connected devices

## Testing
- Develop unit tests for Ansible integration functions
- Perform integration tests with various Ansible playbooks
- Conduct user testing for the Ansible management interface

## Documentation
- Add user documentation for Ansible integration features
- Create developer documentation for the Ansible modules

## Estimated Time
[Provide an estimate for implementing this feature]

## Dependencies
- Ansible library
- PyQt5 for UI components

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Complexity in managing Ansible inventories and playbooks
  Mitigation: Implement a user-friendly interface for Ansible management

- Risk: Performance impact when running large playbooks
  Mitigation: Implement background execution and progress tracking
