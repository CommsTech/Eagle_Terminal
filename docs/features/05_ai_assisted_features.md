# AI-Assisted Features

## Objective
Enhance Eagle Terminal with AI-powered features to assist users in command suggestions, output analysis, and troubleshooting.

## Implementation Details

1. Update `ai/chief.py`:
   - Implement advanced command suggestion algorithms
   - Add output analysis functionality
   - Implement troubleshooting assistance

2. Create `ai/models/command_model.py`:
   - Implement a machine learning model for command prediction

3. Update `ui/tabs/ssh_tab.py`:
   - Add UI elements for displaying AI suggestions and analysis
   - Implement interaction with AI features

4. Create `ui/dialogs/ai_settings_dialog.py`:
   - Implement a dialog for configuring AI settings

## Testing
- Develop unit tests for AI functionality
- Perform integration tests with various command scenarios
- Conduct user testing for AI feature usability

## Documentation
- Add user documentation for AI-assisted features
