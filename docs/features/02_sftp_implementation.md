# SFTP Implementation

## Objective
Implement SFTP functionality to allow secure file transfers within the Eagle Terminal application.

## Implementation Details

1. Update `Functions/ssh_manager.py`:
   - Add SFTP session management
   - Implement file upload and download methods
   - Add directory listing and navigation functions

2. Enhance `ui/tabs/ssh_tab.py`:
   - Add a file browser interface for local and remote systems
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for file transfers
   - Add progress indicators for file transfer operations

3. Update `ui/dialogs/new_session_wizard.py`:
   - Add option to enable SFTP for new connections

4. Create `ui/dialogs/sftp_dialog.py`:
   - Implement a dedicated SFTP dialog for file management

## Testing
- Develop unit tests for SFTP functionality
- Perform integration tests with various SFTP servers
- Conduct user testing for the file transfer interface

## Documentation
- Update user documentation with SFTP usage instructions
- Add developer documentation for the SFTP implementation

## Estimated Time
[Provide an estimate for implementing this feature]

## Dependencies
- Paramiko library for SFTP functionality
- PyQt5 for UI components

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Performance issues with large file transfers
  Mitigation: Implement chunked file transfers and progress tracking

- Risk: Compatibility issues with different SFTP server implementations
  Mitigation: Extensive testing with various SFTP server types and versions
