# Network Discovery

## Objective
Implement network discovery functionality to allow users to scan and identify devices on the network.

## Implementation Details

1. Create `utils/network_scanner.py`:
   - Implement IP range scanning
   - Add port scanning functionality
   - Implement device fingerprinting

2. Update `ui/main_window/main_window.py`:
   - Add a network discovery tab or dialog
   - Implement UI for initiating and displaying scan results

3. Create `ui/dialogs/network_discovery_dialog.py`:
   - Implement a dialog for configuring and initiating network scans

4. Update `Functions/ssh_manager.py`:
   - Add methods to initiate connections to discovered devices

## Testing
- Develop unit tests for network scanning functions
- Perform integration tests on various network configurations
- Conduct security testing to ensure safe scanning practices

## Documentation
- Add user documentation for network discovery features
- Create developer documentation for the network scanning modules

## Estimated Time
[Provide an estimate for implementing this feature]

## Dependencies
- Scapy or Nmap for network scanning
- PyQt5 for UI components

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Potential security concerns with active scanning
  Mitigation: Implement passive scanning options and user warnings

- Risk: Performance impact on large networks
  Mitigation: Implement incremental scanning and result caching
