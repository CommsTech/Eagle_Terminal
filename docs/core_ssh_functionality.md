# Core SSH Functionality Enhancement

## Objective
Improve the core SSH client functionality to provide a robust and feature-rich terminal experience.

## Implementation Details

1. Update `ui/dialogs/new_session_wizard.py`:
   - Add fields for SSH key selection
   - Implement advanced SSH options (port forwarding, compression)
   - Allow custom environment variable specification
   - Add session configuration saving

2. Enhance `ui/tabs/ssh_tab.py`:
   - Implement better terminal emulation (more escape sequences, colors)
   - Add support for multiple simultaneous sessions in tabs
   - Implement session logging
   - Add terminal resizing functionality

3. Improve `connections/ssh_connection.py`:
   - Enhance error handling and connection retry logic
   - Implement connection keep-alive mechanisms
   - Add support for SSH tunneling and port forwarding

4. Update `Functions/ssh_manager.py`:
   - Implement session management (save, load, edit configurations)
   - Add support for managing multiple simultaneous connections
   - Implement connection pooling for better performance

5. Enhance `ui/elements/ssh_console.py`:
   - Improve text selection and copy/paste functionality
   - Implement local echo and line editing
   - Add command history and autocomplete features

## Testing
- Develop unit tests for new SSH connection handling
- Create integration tests for the enhanced SSH functionality
- Perform manual testing of the terminal emulation and user interface

## Documentation
- Update user documentation with new SSH features and options
- Create developer documentation for the enhanced SSH modules

## Estimated Time
[Provide an estimate for implementing this feature]

## Dependencies
- Paramiko library for SSH functionality
- PyQt5 for UI components

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Performance issues with multiple simultaneous connections
  Mitigation: Implement connection pooling and optimize resource usage

- Risk: Compatibility issues with different SSH server implementations
  Mitigation: Extensive testing with various SSH server types and versions
